											It was June 1982, I was 2 and a half. Little did i know that when Elliot stumbled onto ET in the field next to his house, a scene that made me shreak in terror, doing the same to the theatre full of people, would be my first memory to forever set the curious tone of my life and the fuel the question of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c5WVU5XmRw"> "How did they do that?"</a>

						<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
						<p>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
